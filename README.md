# StupidCompress
Super-Fast Compression tool for sinlge files under 2GB. Compresses single files into .png. I didnt expect it to work as good as it does and it wont replace .zip but i thought it might be worth sharing. 

# **Install**
No Install required. The last stable and working build is in the [Latest Build](https://github.com/DomDom3333/StupidCompress/tree/master/Latest%20Build) Folder. Download and use. Enjoy!

# Known Bugs
- Limited to 2GB files due to byte array limitations
- Messaging services like Messenger or WhatsApp remove alpha channel, thereby corrupting the compressed file.
- Metadata gets lost on compression, effectivly breaking video files and other metadata dependant files
