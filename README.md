# StupidCompress
Super-Fast Compression tool for sinlge files under 2GB. Compresses single files into .png.

# **Install**
No Install required. The last stable and working build is in the [Latest Build](https://github.com/DomDom3333/StupidCompress/tree/master/Latest%20Build) Folder. Download and use. Enjoy!

# Known Bugs
- Limited to 2GB files due to .png limitations
- Very small (eg: ~5kb) initial files can cause problems when decompressing. Program doesnt recognise png file as one of its own. This only happens when the ORIGINAL file is small.
- Messaging services like Messenger or WhatsApp remove alpha channel, thereby corrupting the compressed file.
